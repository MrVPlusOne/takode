# Takode Changelog

## 2026-08-31

### Changed

- **Session identity projection** -- Compact navigation rows take session names, claimed-quest fields, and live-only rename animation from one synchronized authority while detail, mutation, and recovery state remain separate

### Fixed

- **Build mismatch actions** -- Takode distinguishes the browser-loaded frontend, server-served frontend, and backend build; Reload is offered only for a coherent server pair, while broken or identity-less pairs request a full restart and stale probes cannot restore the wrong banner

## 2026-08-30

### Added

- **Build compatibility enforcement** -- Takode detects incompatible frontend/backend builds, shows an explicit recovery notice instead of silently keeping mixed versions, and prepares and validates replacement frontends before interrupting the current compatible pair

### Changed

- **Codex compaction accounting** -- Ordinary usage uses the provider's last total while prompt input, configured capacity, and compaction cause stay distinct; uncorrelated automatic compactions remain cause-unknown instead of receiving synthetic charged-context claims
- **Scheduled quest tabs** -- In-motion work stays ahead of queued or proposed tabs, scheduled tabs can be dismissed without changing board state, and genuine activation can resurface them safely
- **Session navigation authority** -- Compatible builds use one canonical server row across navigation surfaces, so stale REST state cannot make active sessions appear idle while first-upgrade migration and raw actions remain safe
- **Leader thread authority** -- Current-build leader tabs use one synchronized visual authority with preserved phase colors, ordering, routing, current-run fencing, and bounded persisted-tab migration
- **Browser conversation synchronization** -- Current-build browsers use one bounded server-authored history and thread path; routine full-history and unused sidecar delivery are removed while explicit recovery, routing, attachments, and replay remain intact
- **Session attention authority** -- Compact unread, needs-input, and timer visuals use one fail-closed synchronized projection across browsers while notification detail, permissions, persisted read state, and mutation remain authoritative separately

### Fixed

- **Interrupted leader continuation** -- Interrupted Codex leader work stays visibly recoverable in its thread; one safe continuation can finish missing work without replaying completed actions, and generic errors disappear only after recovery actually queues
- **Prolonged Codex outages** -- Eligible exact pending work continues low-frequency recovery beyond finite reconnect cycles without duplicate execution, persistent retry noise, or unbounded storage

## 2026-08-29

### Added

- **Inline quest feed previews** -- Chat-feed quest links remain direct while compact validated status and same-color eyes open canonical full previews with accessible keyboard and touch behavior plus fail-closed thread routing

### Changed

- **Synchronized session attention** -- Session rows, aggregates, search and cron results, reviewer badges, and hover cards begin sharing one server-authored attention value while detailed notifications and actions remain authoritative
- **Codex collapsed response phases** -- Official nullable Codex phases select collapsed final responses, commentary stays expanded-only, and genuinely unannotated history keeps a conservative fallback without exposing hidden routing or reasoning fields
- **Session navigation projections** -- Lists, groups, hover cards, links, and selected-session surfaces begin sharing bounded server-authored navigation state while established backend actions remain authoritative
- **Leader thread projections** -- Quest tabs begin using synchronized Journey and participant state with semantic phase colors while preserving existing navigation, attention, and first-upgrade migration behavior

### Fixed

- **Sidebar unread propagation** -- Unselected rows, hover cards, and Session Space totals share one server-authored unread summary, so fresh Ready counts reach other browsers before selection while stale or closed attention stays suppressed

## 2026-08-28

### Added

- **Natural explanation guidance** -- Bundled cross-agent guidance favors natural, audience-aware, fresh-reader, concept-first explanations while leaving format and workflow choices to agent judgment and narrower rules
- **Pending attachment slots** -- Explicit message images reserve ordered accessible loading tiles and become previews in place; terminal failures disappear while speculative paths remain silent

### Changed

- **Intent-first quest creation** -- Leaders preserve requested outcomes, confirmed or mandatory constraints, and hard-to-recover evidence without turning unconfirmed ideas or technical plans into binding scope
- **Codex subagent workspace** -- Native child inspection uses the full chat workspace with compact responsive navigation, oldest-to-newest paging, dismissible warnings, and no empty controls for sessions without genuine children
- **Accepted Work handoff** -- Accepted Work and its synchronized commit or explicit no-code evidence appear before mandatory Memory, while stale or missing evidence is blocked
- **Recent and Messages search** -- Universal Search's query-free Recent view shows one latest human message per destination, while scoped Messages preserves every matching message with canonical routing and evidence-backed status
- **Completed waiting tabs** -- Completed quest tabs stay visually active while their authoritative state is Thread Waiting and return to muted when the wait clears or becomes Ready

### Fixed

- **Codex turn settlement** -- Delivered stale owners drain before queued work and reconnect snapshots missing locally observed tools become actionable no-replay interruptions instead of stuck or repeated output
- **Message route restoration** -- Deliberate manual scrolling retires superseded message-route and pending-target ownership so Browser Back no longer snaps to an obsolete search target while fresh links and automatic restoration remain intact
- **Production frontend snapshots** -- Production serves validated app-owned frontend copies and uses application readiness separately from backend liveness, preserving the last good UI when replacement builds or cleanup fail
- **Quest feedback links** -- Canonical feedback links keep stable zero-based targets through reload, browser history, collapsed Journey history, and deletion tombstones
- **Native child feed isolation** -- Ordinary root chat, navigation, searches, reasoning groups, and lifecycle state exclude proven Codex child activity while canonical child audit history remains inspectable

## 2026-08-27

### Added

- **Native Codex subagent inspector** -- A server-owned registry and read-only responsive inspector show genuine child reasoning, messages, tools, results, and errors chronologically with bounded privacy-safe history and fail-closed partial or legacy coverage
- **Shared Markdown math** -- Safe accessible KaTeX rendering for dollar and stored backslash delimiters preserves exact source, copy, selection, malformed fallback, streaming, tables, and local overflow
- **HTML file browser tabs** -- Resolved HTML file links open in native new tabs with scripts and supported relative assets through capability-scoped serving without granting Takode API, session, or generic filesystem authority

### Changed

- **Quest CLI plugin workflow** -- The Codex plugin makes the existing Quest CLI the sole public Quest interface, routes mutations through live Takode authority, preserves managed sessions, and retains focused Todo, Memory, and Lease MCP tools
- **Expanded quest reconciliation** -- Same-quest design-to-build continuations require immediate title, description, and TLDR reconciliation before implementation resumes, with delivery claims gated by synchronized evidence

### Fixed

- **Leader reconnect viewport** -- Lifecycle snapshots and stale-anchor migration preserve the real selected message and offset across reconnects, reloads, and delayed hydration without weakening fresh navigation
- **Queued Codex inputs** -- Text and image messages steer or safely restart at the earliest supported point, with one owner-scoped pending state and safe Retry, Edit, and Cancel actions that prevent replay and starvation

## 2026-08-26

### Added

- **Takode Codex plugin** -- An opt-in plugin packages Takode integration for ordinary Codex tasks while managed Takode sessions retain their existing identity and lifecycle

### Changed

- **Design-to-delivery continuity** -- One intended design-and-build outcome stays in one quest through explicit checkpoint routing, preserves worker-owned closure, and requires delivery evidence before testability claims

### Fixed

- **Passive leader returns** -- Re-entering a leader session preserves the actual selected thread and stable viewport instead of letting stale layout continuity or late hydration switch the user elsewhere
- **Stale Codex recovery owners** -- Automatic-input recovery shows exact-owner testing or active state, retires provider-proven completed owners, preserves held inputs exactly once, and stops stale work from replaying across reconnect or watchdog cycles

## 2026-08-24

### Added

- **Recent asks** -- Universal Search adds a bounded global view of exact human-request bundles with canonical quest links, stable message jumps, compact expandable text, and evidence-backed response status without rendering response bodies

### Changed

- **Voice rerun offers** -- Append-to-edit and edit-to-append reruns share one compact status, action, and dismiss row while preserving the result and same-audio in-memory rerun behavior
- **Evidence-based safety scope** -- Leader and worker guidance preserves access safeguards, requires explicit direction, policy, an approved contract, or payload evidence before fidelity-changing transformations, and requires existing authority or a User Checkpoint for material scope, cost, validation, or acceptance expansion

### Fixed

- **Attached-message chronology** -- Older requests and reasoning attached to a live quest thread retain their canonical position above newer completion, quiz, and Ready content, matching refresh without duplicate tails or viewport jumps
- **Retained quest titles** -- Completed, cancelled, or board-removed leader tabs keep canonical Questmaster titles across tabs, headers, navigation, and hover instead of falling back to repeated IDs

## 2026-08-16

### Changed

- **Transcription Debug loading** -- The newest 15 records load first with older archive pages on demand, and replay transcription selection covers built-in, configured, and source-record models
- **Recurring timer history** -- Contiguous compatible firings of the same unchanged timer compact into one counted expandable row while every real timestamped firing, stable search or deep-link identity, audit detail, and work-trigger boundary remains intact

### Fixed

- **Leader quest tab surfacing** -- Queued or proposed quests reopen their leader tab when work becomes active and stay discoverable through completion or reload, while later manual closes remain respected

## 2026-08-15

### Changed

- **Worker-send activity** -- Collapsed activity labels pure `takode send` invocations as `Sent a message`, while mixed or ambiguous shell commands retain truthful command labels and full expanded detail

## 2026-08-13

### Added

- **Personal to-dos** -- A separate server-authoritative Markdown Todo/Doing/Done outline supports categories, search, active ordering, marker-first completion, date-grouped history, recoverable drafts, reversible archive, and stale-safe UI Undo, with compact CLI access, proposals and grants, and fail-closed mutation authority

### Changed

- **Mobile participant labels** -- Quest banners show full Leader and Worker labels with role icons through 320px while the selected-session TopBar keeps its compact `#N` identity
- **Work recovery authorization** -- Recoverable interruptions resume the remaining approved Work envelope instead of serial micro-handoffs, while genuine approval and safety gates remain unchanged
- **Codex reasoning selection** -- Ordinary controls show one selected effort and confirmed runtime mismatches add a compact warning, while Codex-reported effective effort remains authoritative for validation and targeted CLI or debug diagnostics
- **Leader decision communication** -- Leader decisions and material status updates lead with the problem, impact, recommendation, choices, and requested answer while incidental technical evidence stays in durable records and approval safeguards remain intact
- **Quest Journey colors** -- Active Alignment, Work, User Checkpoint, and Memory phases use distinct cyan, green, amber, and violet styling with accessible light and dark contrast
- **Codex worker multi-agent mode** -- Normal leader-created Codex workers use native multi-agent V2 by default and existing idle workers migrate through a guarded fresh-thread handoff, while leaders, reviewers, manual sessions, and archived sessions remain on V1

### Fixed

- **Copilot request retries** -- Eligible transient stream failures retry quietly with compact progress; successful recovery hides transient errors, while side-effect uncertainty or exhausted retries still fail closed
- **Recovery ownership** -- Leader escalations, repeated board stalls, and retry indicators stay tied to the exact owning turn or occurrence so later activity cannot consume, suppress, or resurrect stale recovery state
- **Collapsed leader responses** -- Substantive replies remain visible when later outcome reminders add empty or low-value rows, without changing Ready collapse, routing, needs-input priority, or expanded audit history
- **Attached thread rendering** -- Historical attached rows no longer flash phantom duplicates after remounts or thread navigation, while authoritative content and position stay unchanged
- **Empty assistant rows** -- Fully post-processed assistant messages no longer leave blank avatar or menu shells, while status footers, raw history, side effects, and visible child UI remain intact
- **Mobile composer focus** -- Narrow-touch session and thread navigation no longer auto-focuses the composer; drafts, explicit taps, and desktop focus behavior remain intact

## 2026-08-12

### Changed

- **Reasoning detail groups** -- Consecutive compatible Codex reasoning summaries collapse into one newest-summary preview with a count, while expansion preserves every original detail and chronology or ownership boundaries

### Fixed

- **Paused-input banner contrast** -- Automatic-input pause and recovery states use theme-aware text, icon, chip, border, and card colors for readable light and dark themes without changing recovery behavior
- **Leader thread outcomes** -- Fresh same-thread leader text, tool activity, or reasoning clears stale Ready/Waiting footers while preserving historical markers, unread state, and unrelated threads
- **Archived session reconciliation** -- Server-confirmed archives disappear promptly and cannot be resurrected by older in-flight active-session snapshots, while later backend state and lazy archived loading remain authoritative

## 2026-08-10

### Added

- **Role-aware session defaults** -- Settings keep separate server-backed defaults for future Leader and Worker sessions while preserving existing per-group creation choices and explicit overrides
- **Session reconnect controls** -- Codex recovery shows up to five process attempts, offers a fresh-cycle Reconnect action, and lets leaders reconnect eligible owned workers without sending task text
- **Codex reasoning details** -- Each official reasoning-summary part is stored and rendered as its own chronological expandable detail, converging live and completed updates without merged or duplicate rows while redundant root-level thinking rows stay hidden

### Changed

- **Composer model controls** -- Codex model selection uses a compact model-and-effort chip with nested Model, Effort, and capability-gated Speed controls, plus Reset to fresh role defaults
- **Codex Goal browser surface** -- The Session Info Goal editor and browser `/goal` shortcut are removed while backend and CLI Goal state remain available for automatic continuation
- **Alignment and herd context** -- Routine Alignment completion uses normal turn completion instead of an approval prompt, and structured preload or recovery bodies are bounded before leader-model injection while audit history remains available
- **Long tool activity summaries** -- Large collapsed Bash or MCP groups switch to a stable `N tool calls` label while expanded audit detail and smaller descriptive summaries remain intact

### Fixed

- **Passive disconnected sessions** -- Post-restart viewing shows a quiet recoverable-disconnected state instead of a false startup spinner without waking the backend
- **Provider recovery** -- Temporary Copilot authentication or network failures use bounded refresh and replay only provably side-effect-free turns, while unsupported models remain terminal and Claude interruption diagnostics stay out of conversation history
- **Leader activity ownership** -- An idle leader no longer inherits a running worker's route or timer in its activity chip
- **Codex stale delivery replay** -- Already-processed user and mixed herd or system payloads cannot be automatically re-delivered as fresh turns when provider or local model activity proves ownership, while genuinely undelivered user-only work still recovers
- **Cached leader thread refresh** -- Reopening a cached leader tab revalidates its authoritative window so routed worker events and leader responses cannot remain hidden in stale almost-empty history

## 2026-08-08

### Added

- **Direct worker errands** -- Leaders can route one-turn, context-rich, read-only follow-ups directly to an existing worker, while broader or stateful work fails closed to a normal quest

### Changed

- **Browsed-window reconnects** -- Capable browsers reconnect with only the bounded server-authored conversation window currently being viewed instead of passively catching up entire session histories

### Fixed

- **Leader viewport restoration** -- Saved message anchors and routed quest-thread positions survive cold hydration and tab changes, including off-window targets
- **Work Board reminder freshness** -- Delayed dispatchable reminders are tied to the live board-row revision and suppressed when the underlying wait has already changed or cleared

## 2026-08-07

### Changed

- **Selected conversation loading** -- Cold leader startup prioritizes the selected authoritative window before tree, replay, and snapshot work so mobile content appears sooner without sacrificing paging or tool-result closure

## 2026-08-06

### Changed

- **Message timestamp menus** -- Exact message times are available from the existing message menu while rail dots and stars retain their normal navigation and starring behavior
- **Herd event activity** -- Routine non-decision and board-stalled events collapse into compact worker activity while meaningful decisions and complete audit detail remain visible
- **Leader turn summaries** -- Ready leader turns auto-collapse immediately while preserving status-bearing final prose, hiding model-only reminder acknowledgements, and retaining manual expansion

### Fixed

- **Restart continuation context** -- Ordinary restart continuation stays a concise `Continue.` instead of reinjecting the Memory catalog, while new sessions and real compaction or recycle recovery still preload it
- **Completed quest queue banners** -- Completed Journey rows no longer retain stale queued-worker or free-worker wait status, while genuine active and needs-input waits remain visible

## 2026-08-05

### Added

- **Alternate voice reruns** -- A completed voice result can be rerun in append or voice-edit mode using the active in-memory audio without recording again

### Changed

- **Worker reclamation safety** -- Leader guidance treats clean behind-only worktrees as safely replaceable while preserving dirty or genuinely ahead workers and requiring fresh target-ref checks

### Fixed

- **Journey participant projection** -- Active and completed rows for the same quest no longer leave stale worker or reviewer state, and unsynced tracked work remains in Work until its evidence is settled

## 2026-08-04

### Added

- **Audited quest recovery** -- Owning leaders have a reason-required, server-authenticated fallback for exceptional stuck quest completion while normal worker completion remains the preferred path
- **External dependency wakeups** -- Leaders receive targeted board reminders when external session or quest blockers resolve, with cleared dependencies removed from the waiting row

### Changed

- **Leader and worker handoffs** -- Post-Alignment Work dispatches carry only leader-owned deltas, implementation follow-ups prefer the context-rich worker or accepted evidence, and workers report at meaningful milestones
- **Self-contained quest context** -- Refined quest records carry concise standalone background and true follow-up differences instead of depending on linked history for essential context

### Fixed

- **Leader quest tab titles** -- Quest tabs preserve their real Questmaster titles instead of degrading into repeated quest IDs
- **Memory completion Git refresh** -- Final Memory refreshes worker Git state through the server-owned path so completion sees current sync state without weakening identity checks
- **Needs-input decision panels** -- The owning thread again shows the real question, choices, custom reply field, supported voice input, and authoritative loading or retry state

## 2026-08-03

### Added

- **Codex leader compaction mode** -- Leaders can opt into Codex built-in compaction while Takode recycling remains the default and delegation stays available in either mode
- **Sessionless Takode inspection** -- Ordinary Codex contexts can read session and history state without a session identity while invalid authentication, mutations, and unrelated protected operations remain rejected
- **Compact tool activity** -- A Settings option condenses consecutive passive tool calls into categorized expandable summaries while keeping notification and approval interactions visible

### Changed

- **Quest Journey v2** -- New work uses Alignment, Work, and final Memory with User Checkpoint as a Work pause, while legacy Journey history stays readable and completion requires clean synchronized evidence
- **Checkpoint shortcut prompts** -- Notification shortcuts must be explained in the visible decision packet before they are offered, preserving exact-approval safety

### Fixed

- **Completed tool-result closure** -- Visible completed tools receive their latest matching result preview before optional support trimming so historical commands do not reappear as live during later turns

## 2026-08-02

### Added

- **Relay supervision tooling** -- An opt-in monitor-free direct-SSH supervisor package provides transactional ownership, bounded private events, trusted retries, and stale-proof readiness evidence while activation remains separately controlled

### Changed

- **Browser title attention count** -- The tab-title number represents only active unresolved and unmuted needs-input prompts across non-archived sessions, independent of other in-app attention indicators

## 2026-08-01

### Added

- **Quest reviewer identity** -- Leader quest banners show the authoritative Reviewer beside the Worker and keep that identity current through lifecycle refreshes

### Changed

- **Automatic recovery guidance** -- Recovery banners explain the sanitized cause, original pause time, required direct action, and eventual held-input outcome consistently across browsers

### Fixed

- **Historical Journey routes** -- Legitimate completed Explore-to-Implement history remains valid across later board operations while malformed phase data fails closed before provenance can be rewritten
- **Large conversation restoration** -- Mobile and desktop sessions restore through compact authoritative projections and bounded visible windows instead of showing a false-empty Main view

## 2026-07-31

### Added

- **Held-input recovery receipts** -- Automatic-pause recovery keeps durable, sanitized, exact-once outcome records across retry, restart, and ownership handoff, with bounded searchable history and no payload disclosure

### Changed

- **Edit-and-approve checkpoints** -- One fresh reply may make one exact substitution and approve the resulting packet only when every unchanged term and consequence remains unambiguous; all broader edits require a revised packet

## 2026-07-30

### Changed

- **Inbound handoff markers** -- Destination quest feeds hide redundant inbound transition rows while source threads retain the outbound breadcrumb and All Threads keeps the complete audit
- **Raw protocol recording** -- Automatic Claude, Codex, and browser payload capture is off by default while explicit environment opt-in, manual per-session capture, and existing-file inspection remain available
- **Model migration notices** -- Legacy model-identity warnings can be acknowledged across browsers and restarts without erasing audit history, and stale acknowledgements cannot hide a newer event

## 2026-07-29

### Changed

- **Replay comparison layout** -- Transcription Replay & compare starts collapsed while Raw Transcript stays visible and comparison details remain accessible on demand

### Fixed

- **Managed model identity** -- Codex routing fails closed when the selected model cannot be proven, preventing silent drift or fallback while retaining one-time legacy migration provenance

## 2026-07-28

### Added

- **GPT Transcribe voice model** -- New voice-transcription settings default to `gpt-transcribe` with bounded vocabulary and expected-language hints while preserving older and custom model compatibility
- **Transcription replay comparisons** -- Transcription Detail can re-run stored audio or raw transcripts against selected models, save comparison variants, and rediscover a privacy-bounded recording archive after restart
- **Transcription record previews** -- Transcription Debug rows show bounded single-line enhanced-first or raw-fallback excerpts, while unsafe and non-ready records remain preview-free
- **Replay difference highlighting** -- Re-transcribe and re-enhance comparisons highlight stage-correct text changes with readable bounded fallbacks for long inputs

### Changed

- **Composer and Questmaster density** -- The composer condenses model controls into one chip and removes branch/diff metadata, while the compact quest table drops its User review checks column
- **Expected language picker** -- Selected language hints remain visible while the searchable picker stays collapsed until requested

### Fixed

- **Session unread consistency** -- Compact lists, live updates, and selection hydration share one server-authored notification projection so read or closed-thread alerts cannot inflate counts while legitimate unread stays visible
- **Copilot authentication exhaustion** -- Codex sessions pause automatic inputs after a strictly recognized terminal API-key refresh failure while preserving manual recovery and exact-once backlog drain

## 2026-07-27

### Changed

- **Delegate task results** -- Delegate traces group Bash commands with their results, lead with the child summary, and separate task, timing, and inspection metadata from result content

### Fixed

- **Delegate task context** -- Native-fork delegates resume the expected inherited Codex context, fail closed instead of silently starting fresh, and keep pending handoff state accurate
- **Backend startup labels** -- Session creation shows launch progress for Codex, Claude Code, or Claude SDK according to the selected backend
- **Leader route splits** -- Thread routing recognizes split markers even when blank spacer lines surround them

## 2026-07-26

### Changed

- **Delegate task contract** -- The command-only delegation tool is now the general `delegate_task(task)` workflow while retaining hidden child evidence, lifecycle safeguards, and compact parent results

### Fixed

- **Codex startup recovery** -- Queued work waits for initializing or resuming adapters to become ready instead of relaunching them prematurely, and internal initialization turn-end rows stay out of leader activity

## 2026-07-25

### Added

- **Quest commit diffs** -- Leader quest tabs can open quest-recorded code commits with selected-first loading, clear zero-code states, and protection from stale background failures

### Changed

- **Message dates** -- Message timestamps stay time-only today and add compact yesterday, current-year, or prior-year date context for older history
- **Quest Journey details** -- Long phase histories are grouped and windowed so current runs stay readable while older notes remain accessible

### Fixed

- **Delegate child lifecycle** -- Completed hidden delegates leave active session lists without losing UUID-backed transcript inspection

## 2026-07-24

### Changed

- **Post-Explore routing** -- Leaders can revise a completed Explore directly to a clear low-risk Implement step while required User Checkpoints and later safeguards remain protected
- **Light theme contrast** -- Chat, quest links, attention rows, and related light-theme surfaces have clearer text and state contrast

## 2026-07-23

### Added

- **Delegated work** -- Leaders can fork bounded work into a hidden Codex child, keep raw evidence in the child transcript, and receive a compact inspectable parent result

### Changed

- **Bash result visibility** -- Codex Bash cards prefer fuller matching output, mark embedded newlines in collapsed previews, and bound retained raw output
- **Injected event details** -- Injected events show payload size metadata, and memory-catalog snapshots can be copied from their feed rows

### Fixed

- **Thread routing boundaries** -- Mid-message route splits, deep-link scroll targets, and stale ready-status chips resolve to the intended thread without repeated navigation
- **Codex tool readiness** -- Startup and delegated-child prompts wait for refreshed MCP tools and an actual callable handoff tool before proceeding

## 2026-07-22

### Added

- **Memory catalog startup context** -- Leader startup and recovery receive a visible catalog snapshot so relevant durable memory can be inspected before work continues

### Changed

- **Leader tab selection** -- Relevant quest tabs can surface in the background without automatically replacing the leader's selected thread

### Fixed

- **Thread-aware message links** -- Session and message links select the intended thread before jumping to their target
- **Codex shell environment** -- Session-scoped Codex shell tools preserve the configured home directory and its isolated session state

## 2026-07-21

### Added

- **Journey revisions** -- `takode board revise` can replace an active Journey suffix while preserving completed phase history and validating required safeguards

### Changed

- **Board proposals** -- `takode board propose --summary` creates and presents one expanded approval packet with Journey and dependency context

### Fixed

- **Thread continuation links** -- Continuation markers keep their session and quest links when rendered in collapsed feed history

## 2026-07-20

### Added

- **Questmaster local backups** -- Quest and Journey text gains retained local snapshots and mutation journals, with separately deduplicated image blobs and manual restore guidance

### Fixed

- **Needs-input retries** -- Notification retries anchor to visible prompts, deduplicate only exact active retries, and report recovered notification state more accurately
- **Quest hover previews** -- Quest links validate cached preview metadata before rendering so stale summaries do not appear under the wrong quest

## 2026-07-17

### Changed

- **Leader ready outcomes** -- Leader workflows verify promised durable actions before marking a thread Ready

### Fixed

- **All Threads status noise** -- Internal thread-status chips stay out of the combined All Threads feed

## 2026-07-15

### Changed

- **Quest reference autocomplete** -- Composer quest references use the full authoritative candidate set instead of only the currently loaded quest page

### Fixed

- **Message navigator jumps** -- User-message navigation loads off-window targets before scrolling to them
- **Internal status rows** -- Codex retry turn-end events and Thread Ready bookkeeping stay out of the visible conversation feed

## 2026-07-14

### Added

- **Leader skill preloading** -- Leader sessions preload required orchestration skills during startup and recovery so recycled or resumed leaders regain Journey guidance more reliably

### Changed

- **Needs-input suggestions** -- Needs-input prompts can carry more short suggested answers, with guidance updated to keep choices useful without an arbitrary cap
- **Checkpoint approval guidance** -- Leader and checkpoint instructions distinguish actual user decisions from corrections more explicitly before continuing work
- **Leader work summaries** -- Session summaries show waiting counts, and newly started Journeys receive clearer attention treatment

### Fixed

- **Leader preload recovery reminders** -- Recovery reminders avoid false compaction signals during resume replay and point leaders back to preload state more accurately
- **Quest Quiz directives** -- Inline quiz directives render after their quest details arrive instead of remaining unresolved in fetched history

## 2026-07-13

### Changed

- **Quest Journey routing** -- Leaders can use lighter direct dispatch for low-risk tasks, and Outcome Review is optional when the approved Journey does not need a separate acceptance pass
- **Codex launch defaults** -- Codex catalog handling disables unsupported Responses Lite options for MAI LiteLLM catalogs and gives non-leader sessions a safer auto-compact default

### Fixed

- **Quest link previews** -- Quest links show hover previews more reliably
- **Codex model switching** -- Model changes, relaunches, leader context preservation, failed compaction recovery, and recycle watermarks recover more reliably without duplicate migration loops
- **Archived session recovery** -- Archived-session relaunch and partial archive-group failures reconcile UI and server state more consistently

## 2026-07-11

### Changed

- **Codex model catalog** -- Model pickers include refreshed Codex options and runtime-setting updates, with future reasoning parameters preserved for compatible models

## 2026-07-09

### Changed

## 2026-07-02

### Changed

- **Quest Quiz guidance** -- Completion guidance makes quiz questions more useful and better grounded in agent-discovered outcomes

### Fixed

- **Thread route splitting** -- Post-quiz routes, split thread routes, and ready-thread unread views avoid cumulative append and stale read-state issues

## 2026-07-01

### Fixed

- **Reviewer sidebar chips** -- Reviewer labels fit and render consistently in sidebar chips
- **Diff syntax highlighting** -- Unified diff panels highlight syntax more reliably

- **Thread-scoped pending delivery** -- Pending-delivery state stays scoped to the relevant thread tabs
- **Leader worktree port metadata** -- Spawn and port metadata carries worktree context more reliably for leader-managed ports

## 2026-06-29

### Added

- **Session configuration** -- Existing sessions can be reconfigured from session menus and info surfaces, with live backend updates when supported
- **Starred messages** -- Chat messages can be starred from message actions, searched globally, and shown with compact feed-rail markers for easier follow-up

### Changed

- **Context diagnostics CLI** -- Context diagnostics focus on `takode scan --context` and `takode peek --context`, with misleading standalone command references removed
- **Codex context display** -- Codex context window displays use clearer capacity wording across configuration, hover, info, and settings surfaces

### Fixed

- **Message link navigation** -- Links to specific chat messages load the targeted feed window, preserve main-thread routes, and highlight the jump target after navigation
- **Configure Session state** -- Reconfiguration state, live update detection, and modal placement stay consistent across sidebar, top-bar, and session-info entry points
- **Session status indicators** -- Session status dots stay visible on hover, and hover cards match the sidebar marker state more consistently
- **Starred message controls** -- Star actions avoid temporary fallback message IDs, and starred markers stay out of the main message content area
- **Unread session attention** -- Session attention indicators avoid stale unread state after notification updates

## 2026-06-28

### Added

- **Context diagnostics** -- `takode scan --context` and `takode peek --context` expose reported usage and bounded payload navigation hints for leader context-health debugging
- **Muted needs-input notifications** -- Needs-input prompts can be muted while preserving visible inbox and navigation state for unresolved items

### Changed

- **Quest CLI summaries** -- `quest show` output is more compact by default while keeping reveal paths for full descriptions, metadata, and phase notes
- **Prompt guardrails** -- Session instructions now make durable-name constraints clearer for quest IDs in code, commits, artifacts, and other lasting names

### Fixed
