/**
 * Host-local state guard: code that runs on a Takode host takes Takode
 * settings and data from the coordinator, never from this machine's
 * `~/.companion` (CLAUDE.md, "Takode config and data live on the coordinator").
 *
 * Host-side files are the agent CLIs and helpers in `bin/` (installed on every
 * host) and the `takode node` agent's entry modules. The test lists every way
 * they reach `~/.companion` directly: a path they name themselves, or a server
 * module they import that names one or keeps coordinator data. Each one must be
 * in the inventory below with the reason it is allowed, usually because it is
 * a fact of this machine (where tools and checkouts live, its name, its own
 * credentials) rather than Takode configuration. A new entry fails until it is
 * either moved to the coordinator or added here with its reason; an entry that
 * no longer exists fails too, so the inventory stays accurate.
 *
 * The check covers host-side files and their direct imports, not everything
 * those modules import in turn: deeper code is reviewed against the rule.
