# Running sessions on another machine

One Takode server, the **coordinator**, can run sessions on other machines,
called **hosts**. The coordinator keeps all shared state (sessions, quests,
memory, the board) and serves the browser. A host only runs the session
processes: it runs `takode node`, which connects out to the coordinator, so the
host needs no open inbound ports.

Use this when a project, its data or its hardware lives on another machine,
such as a cloud workspace or a GPU box, and you want its sessions in the same
Takode as everything else.

## Requirements on the host

- A Takode checkout with its dependencies installed:
  `bun install --cwd web --frozen-lockfile`. Keep it at the coordinator's
  commit (see [Updating Takode](#updating-takode)); the coordinator refuses a
  host that speaks an older protocol ("Update takode on the host").
- The agent CLIs its sessions use (`claude`, `codex`), each signed in on that
  machine. Credentials are never copied between machines.
- The project checkouts the sessions will work in.
- Git 2.36 or newer (check with `git --version`). Takode uses Git options that
  older versions lack, such as `git worktree list -z`. Sessions look for tools
  in `~/.local/bin` and the standard system directories (such as
  `/usr/local/bin` and `/usr/bin`) before directories that are only on
  `takode node`'s own `PATH`. So starting the node with a newer Git first on its
  `PATH` is not enough when an older one is installed system-wide: install or
  link the newer one into `~/.local/bin`.

Do not start a Takode server on the host. `takode node` is the only Takode
process it needs.

The host keeps no Takode configuration or data of its own. Settings come from
the coordinator, which stores the ones that differ per machine (such as which
Claude Code and Codex to run) for each host, and the `quest`, `memory` and
`stream` commands of its sessions read and write through the coordinator.
Session processes on the host get `TAKODE_REMOTE_HOST=1`, so these commands
never answer from files the machine may still have under `~/.companion` (for
example from a time it ran its own server); while the coordinator is
unreachable they say so instead. Only facts of the machine stay on it: its
name, its host token, the options `takode node` was started with, and working
checkouts.

## Setup

1. **Register the host on the coordinator.** Run `takode host add <name>` or use
   **Settings → Hosts**. The host's token is shown only once. On the
   host, save it to a file only you can read:

   ```bash
   umask 077 && printf '%s' '<token>' > ~/.takode-host-token
   ```

   `takode host remove <name>` revokes the token.

2. **Give the host a way to reach the coordinator's host port.** Besides its
   main port (3456 for production), the coordinator listens on a **host
   port**, its main port plus 1000 (4456 for production; set
   `COMPANION_HOST_LINK_PORT` to choose another). The host port serves only
   callers with a token: the host link and agent CLIs. Point hosts at it, not
   at the main port (see [Shared machines](#shared-machines)). Any of these
   works:
   - an `https://` address that leads to the coordinator's host port;
   - a reverse SSH tunnel opened from the coordinator's machine, so the host
     reaches the coordinator on its own loopback and nothing is exposed to the
     network:

     ```bash
     ssh -R 13456:127.0.0.1:4456 <host>   # 4456 is the coordinator's host port
     ```

     The host then uses `http://127.0.0.1:13456`. `takode node` accepts plain
     `http://` only for loopback addresses (or with `--allow-insecure` when the
     network already encrypts the traffic).
   - a forward tunnel opened from the host, when only the host can connect to
     the coordinator's machine (for example a coordinator in a cloud workspace
     and a laptop as the host): `ssh -L 13456:127.0.0.1:4456 <coordinator>`, or
     the workspace's own port forwarding. The host again uses
     `http://127.0.0.1:13456`. A browser on the host needs a second forward,
     to the main port.

   The coordinator listens on every network interface by default. When it
   should be reachable only through tunnels, start it with
   `COMPANION_HOST=127.0.0.1`.

3. **Start `takode node` on the host** from its Takode checkout:

   ```bash
   bun web/bin/takode-node.ts --coordinator http://127.0.0.1:13456 --token-file ~/.takode-host-token
   ```

   It installs the `takode`, `quest`, `memory` and `stream` CLI wrappers, skills and
   Quest Journey phase briefs from that checkout, then connects. `takode host
   list` on the coordinator shows the host as online.

4. **Start sessions on it.** Pick the host in the **Machine** field of the new
   session dialog, or from a leader run
   `takode spawn --host <name> --cwd <checkout path on the host>`. A leader
   that itself runs on a host spawns its workers there without `--host`. With a host
   selected, the dialog's folder browser and branch picker read the host's
   folders and repos, and recent folders are kept per machine. Worktrees are
   created on the host. Folder browsing needs the host's `takode node` to run a
   build that includes it. A running session's Git status, diffs, the diff
   panel's base-branch and commit choices, and pulls all read its checkout on
   the host. Quest delivery checks (`takode board approve-delivery-target`,
   `record-work-delivery`, `work-to-memory` and port tracking) run on the
   machine holding the worker's port target, and recorded delivery commits are
   read there later; these need the host's `takode node` on a build that
   includes them. The **Terminal** page opens a session's terminal on its
   host; its machine menu, next to the folder, moves the terminal to any
   machine, browsing that machine's folders.

## Shared machines

On a machine that other people also use, such as a node of a shared compute
cluster, every user's processes can connect to its `127.0.0.1` ports. Two
of them lead to the coordinator: the local end of the tunnel and the API proxy
that `takode node` serves for its agent CLIs. Anyone who could use the
coordinator could start sessions and message agents, which runs commands as
you on every machine, so neither may answer an anonymous caller:

- **The host port takes only tokens**, whether or not browser login is on: the
  host link needs its host token, and every other request needs a valid agent
  session token. A tunnel that ends there gives the machine's other users
  nothing without one.
- **The node's API proxy** forwards to the host port, so it refuses anonymous
  callers too. `takode`, `quest` and `memory` run outside a session on the
  host, without a session token, are refused as well.
- **The main port refuses other machines' hosts while browser login is off**,
  because a tunnel to it would let anyone on the host use Takode. The node's
  log then says `Coordinator refused the link (403: ...)` and names the host
  port; point the tunnel there and the node connects again on its own. With
  login on, the main port requires a login or token anyway, so hosts may still
  use it. The coordinator's own node always may.

What remains: root and administrators of the host can read your files,
including the host token and the session tokens in your processes'
environment, and can act as you. Keep the host token file readable only by
you (`umask 077`, as above). On the coordinator's own machine nothing changed:
with browser login off, its main port still serves anyone who can reach it, so
run the coordinator on a machine you do not share, or turn login on.

## Machine names

Every machine has a name that belongs to the machine, kept in its own
`~/.companion/machine.json`, so it stays the same if another machine later
becomes the coordinator. The coordinator names its own machine after its
hostname the first time it starts. A host takes the name it was registered
with, unless it already has a name of its own from another Takode setup, which
it keeps. Rename any machine with **Rename** in **Settings → Hosts**; a host
must be connected to receive its new name.

Each session's instructions and memory catalog say which machine it runs on and
which machine runs the coordinator. Quest notes and debriefs are stamped with
the machine of the session that wrote them, shown next to the author in
Questmaster and in `quest show` and `quest feedback`, because paths and
commands in a note refer to that machine. Notes written before stamps existed
were stamped once by the coordinator on its first start with this feature,
after it saved the whole quest store under
`~/.companion/questmaster-backups/migrations/`; `questmaster-live/machine-stamps.json`
records that run and the backup that undoes it.

Memory notes record the same thing in a `machines:` frontmatter list: the
machines that wrote the note, in the order they first did. The server adds the
writing session's machine on `memory write` and on every `memory commit` except
repairs. The memory catalog names the machine most notes come from once and
tags the others after their path, like `note.md [devbox]`; the Memory page shows
the list on each note. Notes written before this existed were stamped once with
the coordinator's machine on its first start with this feature, as one memory
commit per repo (`git revert` undoes it); `.git/takode-machine-stamps.json` in
the memory repo records that run. A repo that was locked or had uncommitted
changes is tried again at the next start.

## Choosing the agent CLIs on a host

Every machine has its own **Claude Code** and **Codex** settings in
**Settings → Hosts**: the coordinator's own machine, plus one entry per
registered host. Each is a path or command on that machine; an
empty field means the `claude` or `codex` on that machine's `PATH`. The
coordinator stores the settings and sends a host its own whenever it connects
or they change, so there is nothing to copy between machines. New sessions use
a changed setting at once; running ones pick it up when they relaunch.

`takode node` can also be started with `--claude` and `--codex`:

```bash
bun web/bin/takode-node.ts ... --claude /path/to/claude --codex /path/to/codex
```

A flag wins over the host's setting for as long as that node runs, and
**Settings → Hosts** shows which program the flag makes it run. Prefer the
setting; keep the flags for a node that must differ from its stored setting.

For example, to run a host's Claude sessions through GitHub Copilot, run
`scripts/setup-claude-copilot.sh` on the host (see
[Using Takode with GitHub Copilot](github-copilot.md)) and set that host's
**Claude Code** to the launcher it prints.

## Keeping it running

Neither the tunnel nor `takode node` restarts by itself after a reboot. Run each
in a restart loop inside `tmux` (or a service manager), for example:

```bash
# On the coordinator's machine
tmux new -d -s takode-tunnel \
  'while true; do ssh -R 13456:127.0.0.1:4456 <host> -- "while true; do sleep 3600; done"; sleep 5; done'

# On the host
tmux new -d -s takode-node \
  'cd ~/takode && while true; do bun web/bin/takode-node.ts --coordinator http://127.0.0.1:13456 --token-file ~/.takode-host-token --auto-update; sleep 10; done'
```

What survives what:

- **Network drops, host sleep and coordinator restarts:** sessions keep running.
  The host buffers their output and replays it when the link returns, and agent
  CLIs on the host wait for the coordinator instead of failing.
- **Stopping the coordinator** (Ctrl-C, `SIGTERM`; anything but a restart):
  stops the sessions on every connected host, since nobody would see their
  output until the next start. They relaunch and resume their conversation the
  next time they are used; `takode node` itself keeps running. A host that is
  offline at that moment cannot be told, so its sessions keep running and the
  next start takes them over, as after a restart.
- **Restarting `takode node`:** ends the sessions it was running. They relaunch
  and resume their conversation the next time they are used.

## Keeping this machine's sessions across restarts

The coordinator's own sessions survive its restarts the same way: the server
starts a `takode node` on its own machine and runs the processes of sessions
without a host under it. After a restart, the new server takes them over when
that node reconnects: a turn in progress keeps running, its output arrives, and
a pending permission prompt is asked again. When the restart brings new code,
the node is then updated right away (see [Updating Takode](#updating-takode)),
which interrupts such turns and continues them on the new build. **Settings → Hosts** shows the
node's status on the coordinator's own machine, the first entry. Sessions that start
while the node is still connecting, such as just after the server starts, wait
for it; if it does not connect within 30 seconds, they start without it.

The server supervises this node itself: it starts it with the server (also
after a reboot), lets a running one reconnect after a restart, and replaces one
that has exited or stays disconnected for 30 seconds. The node runs from the
server's own checkout, so an update restarts it on that checkout's code (see
[Updating Takode](#updating-takode) for when). Its log is
`~/.companion/logs/local-node-<serverId>.log`.

Only a restart (the Restart Server button) leaves the node and its sessions
running for the next server to take over. Stopping the server stops its
sessions and then the node; they relaunch when next used. Ending the node's
process (the `takode-node.ts` process with `--shared-checkout`) ends its
sessions too; they relaunch when next used, and the server starts a new node.

## Updating Takode

Restart Server loads the code in the coordinator's own checkout. When that
checkout is on a branch that tracks a remote branch, the restart first fetches
it and, if the checkout is clean (no uncommitted changes to tracked files) and
only behind, fast-forwards it, so changes pushed or landed from other checkouts
take effect without updating it by hand. It never touches a checkout with
uncommitted changes or local commits, or one not on a branch: the restart then
loads it as it is. **Settings → Restart** shows which commit the server runs
and where its checkout stands against its branch, with a warning when a
restart would load older code than the branch has. A fast-forward that brings
dependency changes still needs `bun install --cwd web --frozen-lockfile`
before the restart can go ahead; the restart says so.

The host's checkout should run the same commit as the coordinator. `takode
host list` and **Settings → Hosts** show each host's commit and flag a
host on another build.

Start `takode node` with `--auto-update` to let the coordinator keep it in
step. When the host runs another commit, the coordinator stops the host's
sessions and the node checks out the coordinator's commit (fetching it from
the checkout's remote if needed), runs a frozen install and restarts. Its
sessions relaunch on their next message. It refuses to update a checkout with
uncommitted changes, so give the node a checkout of its own rather than one you
work in. When the update happens:

- **After Restart Server**, every such host (and the coordinator's own node)
  updates right away, so all sessions run the new build as on a single
  machine: once the host has reconnected and its sessions are taken over, turns
  in progress are interrupted, the sessions stop, and each interrupted session
  is told to continue once the node is back (or if the update fails).
- **Otherwise** (the coordinator started some other way, a host connected
  later on another build, or a host restarted on its old build after an
  update) it waits until none of the host's sessions is in a turn or running a
  full `takode land test --full`, and none started in the last minute. An
  update after Restart Server does not wait for those test runs (they take
  10+ minutes each); it ends them and tells their sessions to run them again.
- **Never during a landing run** on that host: the update waits for it to
  finish. While the node restarts, anything the coordinator would start there
  waits for the updated node, and new sessions on that host are refused with
  "restarting for a Takode update" until it is back. If the node reconnects
  without having restarted, the coordinator asks it again, so an update that
  failed while the link was down is reported; one that has not brought the node
  back after 15 minutes counts as failed, and what waited runs on the node's
  current build. A failed update is not tried again until the node restarts.

`takode host list` and **Settings → Hosts** say what a pending update is
waiting for.

Without `--auto-update`, update the host's checkout and restart `takode node`
yourself whenever the coordinator is updated.

## Moving the coordinator to another machine

The coordinator role can move to a machine that already runs its sessions as a
host, for example from a laptop to an always-on workstation, while every
session stays on the machine where it runs. `scripts/coordinator-handoff.ts`
moves the data with checksums, relabels sessions to their machines and fences
the old machine; see [Moving the coordinator](moving-the-coordinator.md) for
prerequisites, connectivity, rehearsal, cutover, verification, rollback and
pitfalls.

## Latency

Every command an agent on the host runs (`takode`, `quest`, `memory`, `stream`) is a
round trip to the coordinator, through the tunnel if you use one.
`takode latency` on the host shows that time as transport. A remote terminal
echoes each keystroke after one round trip.
